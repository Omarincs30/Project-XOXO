FINAL
Hi this is my final project. It is a tik-tak-toe game. It is very simple and easy to use. In the game, you have to get a row of three of your shape to win. When you click run, the game starts. It tells you to click the purple box to start the game. If you want to quit at any time during the game, hit the "q" button. This game is made for kids. It is exceptionally direct and easy to use comparred to similar programs.
